# ESP8266_PIC
C library for interfacing the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module with a PIC microcontroller

This library

- is tested with XC8;
- should work on any 8-bit PIC (and possibly also larger systems and AVR);
- has an [example project](https://github.com/camilstaps/ESP8266_PIC/releases/tag/example) available;
- is sadly incomplete, because I stopped working with the ESP8266 quickly.
